# A Study In Budgets

This interactive scrollytelling site examines how the language of Singapore’s Budget speeches has evolved over six decades. Drawing on 61 years of speeches, it traces how responsibility is framed – what the government promises, what it asks of citizens and firms, and how that balance shifts over time.

The project taps AI tools to analyse every paragraph in each speech and classifies whether it articulates a promise, a demand, or neither, as well as who the message is directed at. The goal is not to measure sentiment, but to examine how the state describes obligation, support and participation.

In all, 11,559 paragraphs were analysed from 67 Budget speeches between 1965 and 2026, and here are the broad findings:

| Prime Minister | Years | Promise Ratio |
|----------------|-------|---------------|
| Lee Kuan Yew | 1965–1990 | 54.5% |
| Goh Chok Tong | 1991–2004 | 65.4% |
| Lee Hsien Loong | 2005–2024 | 72.3% |
| Lawrence Wong | 2025–present | 74.4% |

Under founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, Budget speeches balanced promises with demands almost equally. By the current era, promises outweigh demands by more than 2:1.

## Data and data cleaning

Data from this project is based off the corpus of Budget speeches found on [Singapore Hansard records](https://sprs.parl.gov.sg/search/), the official repository of parliamentary proceedings. 

After the speeches were collected, they were manually cleaned to remove non-substantive transcript markers, subheadings, footnotes and appendix references that were not part of the spoken text. A Python script was later used to break the speeches into paragraphs, and further clean the dataset by removing headers missed from the first pass of data cleaning, table data, as well as speech procedure text that make up entire paragraphs ('Mr Speaker, I beg to move'). 

By the end of this process, the corpus comprised roughly 700,000 words across 11,559 paragraphs. Metadata for each speech - including the finance minister, date of delivery and presiding prime minister - was appended at the paragraph level in a CSV file prior to AI augmentation.

### LLM classification

Each paragraph was classified using Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash into five categories:

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Promise to citizens** | Government commitments to help individuals (subsidies, cash, housing, healthcare) |
| **Promise to firms** | Government support for businesses (tax relief, incentives, infrastructure) |
| **Demand on citizens** | Expectations on Singaporeans (adapt, upgrade skills, stay competitive) |
| **Demand on firms** | Expectations on businesses (innovate, transform, reskill workers) |
| **Neutral** | Factual information, procedural language, general policy discussion |

Before deploying AI for full classification, more than 100 paragraphs were manually labelled to establish a validation set. These hand-coded examples were used to iteratively refine and test the classification prompt.

After 11 rounds of prompt revision and spot-checking, the framework achieved over 90% accuracy on the audited validation set. The ninth iteration of the prompt was selected for full-corpus classification, as subsequent revisions began to show declining performance.

SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are an expert classifier specializing in analyzing Singapore political discourse for themes related to fiscal redistribution and civic obligation. Your sole task is to determine if a provided text articulates a promise (prosperity, help, sharing, stability, recovery) or a demand (discipline, participation, compliance, restraint) directed at citizens or firms, and, if so, to categorize it according to a strict set of five themes.

You must adhere to four critical rules:

1. Government updates are neutral - Be very strict: Government announcing what it will do/is doing = neutral, not promise. Promise requires explicit "we will give/help/support citizens/firms" language. Neutral includes: "HDB expected to complete units", "committee investigating", "duty/tax will be removed/changed", "research will be stepped up", "training programme will include", "we introduced GST and gave rebate" (tax history), "careful/prudent planning resulted in" (without emphasizing "importance of discipline"), company examples (Samwoh), fiscal planning explanations, industry descriptions. International affairs, fiscal reports, government plans, speech procedures, case studies, technical fiscal explanations.

2. Target distinction is critical: When there is a behavioral expectation, identify target precisely:
   - Firms: "leaders of companies", "companies must", "firms need to", productivity, competitiveness, "we need to improve productivity"
   - Citizens: "Singaporeans", "our people", "workers", "citizens", "households"
   - Critical: "Leaders of companies play key role... committed to reskilling staff" → demand_firm (leaders are firm representatives)
   - "Our people develop skills" → demand_citizen
   - "Help Singaporeans acquire skills, adapt" → demand_citizen (not promise)

3. Investment/Financial mentions - Check carefully: "Investment commitments amounted to $X" or "investors are confident" = Neutral (just describing investment activity). Promise_firm requires explicit support/promotion language: "we will promote wealth management", "measures to enhance financial services", "we will provide R&D funding". Not just describing investment levels.

4. "Help/support/enable X to do Y" = Demand not Promise: "Help Singaporeans acquire skills, adapt" = demand_citizen + supportive_demand (not promise_citizen). "Support seniors to remain active" = demand_citizen + supportive_demand. The "do Y" is the behavioral expectation.

5. Fiscal discipline language = Demand_citizen: Emphasizing "discipline," "fiscal prudence," "setting aside resources" as crucial behavior = demand_citizen.

6. Environmental targets = Demand_firm: Sector targets like "aim to have 100% cleaner vehicles by 2040" = demand_firm.

7. "Create opportunities for people to develop skills" = Demand_citizen: When text says "create opportunities for our people to develop their skills, creativity and talents" or similar - this expects citizens to develop skills, not a promise_firm to businesses. Check carefully if the expectation is on people (citizens) or firms.

8. Strict output format: Your entire response must consist of exactly eight lines and nothing else."""

USER_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """Follow these steps to analyze the text provided at the end.

Step 1: Government update vs descriptive check

First, determine if the text is only describing what government is doing/planning WITHOUT rallying anyone:
- Government plans, reports, updates, announcements
- Case studies/examples of specific individuals or companies
- Technical fiscal explanations (NIR, reserve management) without "importance of discipline" language
- Government stating "upcoming direction" or "pressing on with efforts"

If yes → neutral. Stop here.

Exception: If example explicitly showcases model behavior others should follow ("addressed it with diligence, determination; move up; improved continuously") → demand_citizen.

Step 2: Check for Investment/Financial Services Mentions

If text mentions investment commitments, investment confidence, financial services promotion, R&D funding, innovation funding, wealth management:
→ promise_firm (unless explicit behavioral expectation for firms)

Step 3: Target audience identification

If not neutral or promise_firm, identify target:
- Firms: companies, businesses, leaders of companies, industries, sectors, "we" (in productivity/competitiveness context), "step up productivity," "lose ground to emerging cities"
- Citizens: Singaporeans, people, workers, households, families, seniors, "adjust to disruptions," "pull up socks"

Step 4: Promise vs. demand classification

Promise: Support without behavioral expectation
- Citizens: subsidies, tax rebates, cash, housing supply, healthcare benefits, "public services at least cost to taxpayer"
- Firms: infrastructure investment (T5, Changi), investment incentives (already classified in Step 2)

Demand: Explicit/implicit behavioral expectation
- Citizens: "pull up socks," "live within means," "incentive to get job," "support seniors to remain active," "adjust to disruptions," "baton is passed," "importance of fiscal discipline," "create opportunities for people to develop skills"
- Firms: "must transform," "innovate," "redesign jobs," "reskill staff," "step up productivity," "leaders must raise capabilities," "if we do not succeed we will lose ground"

Critical: "Support X to do Y" = demand with supportive_demand = 1

Step 5: Supportive demand & framing

If demand_*, check if support enables behavior → supportive_demand = 1
Identify framing: crisis_framing, collective_future_framing, vulnerability_framing, or none

## Word frequency analysis

To track how Budget vocabulary evolved, all paragraphs were tokenised and word frequencies calculated for two periods: 1965–1975 (early era) and 2016–2026 (recent era). Raw counts were normalised to mentions per 10,000 words to account for varying speech lengths across years.

Rising and declining words were identified by comparing the multiplier change between periods. For example, "support" increased from 2.0 to 70.4 mentions per 10,000 words — a 36× increase.

In calculating the finance minister "pet words", the corpus was grouped by minister and words were ranked by how distinctively each FM used them compared to others. This surfaced vocabulary fingerprints: Goh Keng Swee spoke of military and battalions; Tony Tan introduced computer and automation; Lawrence Wong emphasises green and carbon.

## Scrollytelling interface

The website adopts a scrollytelling format inspired by Alvin Chang's project for The Pudding, *[In Pursuit of Democracy](https://pudding.cool/2025/11/democracy/)*. As readers scroll, narrative cards appear on the left while a sticky chart on the right responds to each section, highlighting relevant years, animating transitions, and updating context.

The chart itself is built with [D3.js](https://d3js.org). Each of the 5,879 classified paragraphs is rendered as a small square, coloured by category (coral for promises, blue for demands) and stacked by year. Scroll-triggered transitions use the Intersection Observer API to detect which story card is in view, then update the chart accordingly.

At the end of the narrative, the chart becomes interactive: readers can hover over any square to read the original paragraph, with coordinate-based hit detection used to bypass browser rendering quirks.

**Key tools:**

- **Visualisation:** [D3.js](https://d3js.org) for SVG rendering and data binding
- **Scrollytelling:** Intersection Observer API with CSS sticky positioning
- **Classification:** [Gemini 2.0 Flash](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/) (Google) for paragraph-level analysis
- **Data processing:** Python for corpus cleaning, tokenisation, and frequency analysis
